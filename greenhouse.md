# The greenhouse effect

## Definition

The greenhouse effect is the change in longwave radiation escaping to space due to the presence of an atmosphere.

(Note that this doesn't have much to do with actual greenhouses)

### A concrete example -- the Earth's current atmosphere

GH = -239 $W\,m^{-2}$ - (-398) $W\,m^{-2}$  = 159 $W\,m^{-2}$

## Outline

1. Define some terms

1. Build a model of atmospheric absorption and emission

1. Use the model to calculate the greenhouse effect and the atmospheric heating rate
